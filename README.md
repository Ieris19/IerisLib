# IerisLib
A home for all the code that I might want to reuse in future projects
Most of this code is made for fun and practice and most of it is not really ever to be used as there are usually much better alternatives to my own packages, but it's always good to have software do *EXACTLY* what you want it to do and *JUST* how you want it to do.
